This is the source code of the ADMM algorithm (termed RMDSA) associated with our IEEE SPL paper:

W. Xiong and H. C. So, "TOA-Based Localization With NLOS Mitigation via Robust Multidimensional Similarity Analysis," 
in IEEE Signal Processing Letters, vol. 26, no. 9, pp. 1334-1338, Sept. 2019, doi: 10.1109/LSP.2019.2929860.

You could use the code for your comparisons at will, as long as the paper above is included as a reference in your manuscript.
